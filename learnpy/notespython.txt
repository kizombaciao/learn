// len() can tell you how long a string is, 
the number of elements in lists 
and tuples (another array-like data structure), 
and the number of key-value pairs in a dictionary.

// don't use "len" as a variable name 
to avoid blocking out the len() function.

// The '+' operator can concatenate two strings.
